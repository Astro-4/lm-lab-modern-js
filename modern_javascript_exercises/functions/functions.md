# Functions

In JavaScript here are many different ways to write functions.

In `functions.js`, refactor the `logPerson()` function declaration, into one of each of the following functions.

- Function expression
- Anonymous Function
- Anonymous Arrow Function

Arrow functions are a more modern way of writing JavaScript functions.

Note: There are no tests for this task!
